### 🚀 Launching on Vercel: Step-by-Step

1. **Database Provisioning**: Create a new Postgres database (via free tiers on Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Neon). Retrieve the connection strings.
2. **Project Creation**: Import your GitHub fork into the Vercel dashboard.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy the variables above into the Vercel project settings environment tab.
4. **Deploy**: Hit "Deploy". Vercel will automatically run the build steps (`npm run build`).
5. **Database Push**: Run `npx prisma db push` to generate the client and synchronize database models before launching.
